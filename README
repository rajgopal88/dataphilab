This Project is built using play framework so if you want to use it you need to install play framework. The following link will help in doing so:
https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/Installing

After installing you need to make a database the table is mentioned in the data folder in the root path.

Now we need to change te database configuration in the /conf/application.conf

default.url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<database_name>"
default.username = <username>
default.password = "password"

After doing this just got to the project root path and run the following command:
$activator
$clean
$compile
$reload
$run

After this you need to hit the localhost on 9000 port, which will give you the UI of the project.
